"""Module 6 — measure (and improve) how well your judge agrees with humans.

A judge you don't trust is worse than no judge. So before you rely on an LLM judge
in production, **evaluate the evaluator**: score a set of outputs your humans have
already labeled, and measure how often the judge agrees with them. That agreement
rate is the judge's accuracy.

This script does exactly that, twice:
  1. zero-shot judge (rubric only)            -> agreement with humans
  2. few-shot judge (rubric + labeled examples) -> agreement with humans

The few-shot examples come from the SAME human labels (the kind you'd harvest from
the annotation queue in annotation_queue.py). We hold out a separate slice to score
on, so we're never grading the judge on the examples we taught it with. You should
see the few-shot judge agree with humans more often — that's alignment, no
fine-tuning required.

# A human-labeled "golden" set for the HR house style. These are the labels real
# reviewers produced — the ground truth the judge must match. The convention they
# encode (NOT stated in the rubric): a reply must end with an explicit invitation
# to follow up ("let me know...", "happy to help", "feel free to reach out"). A
# reply can be warm, correct, and concise and still FAIL if it doesn't invite a
# follow-up. That's learnable from examples but not from the vague rubric — which
# is exactly what makes the few-shot lift visible.
