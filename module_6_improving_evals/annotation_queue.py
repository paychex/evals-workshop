"""Module 6 — push production traces to an annotation queue for human review.

Few-shot alignment (few_shot_judge.py) needs human-labeled examples. Where do
those labels come from? An **annotation queue**: a review inbox in LangSmith where
a human opens each trace, reads it, and records a verdict. Those verdicts are the
ground truth you align the judge to — and the examples you feed it few-shot.

You don't queue *everything* (humans don't scale). You queue what's worth a human's
attention: the traces your cheap online evals already flagged. This script pulls
recent production traces, uses the deterministic reference-free checks from Module
5 to prioritize the suspicious ones (deflected or empty answers), and adds them to
a queue. A reviewer then labels them in the UI.

Run:  python module_6_improving_evals/annotation_queue.py [--limit 20] [--project NAME]
