"""Module 6 — an LLM judge you can align with few-shot examples.

A generic LLM judge grades against a generic notion of "good". But your team has a
*house style* the model can't guess from a one-line rubric — and when the judge's
idea of good drifts from your reviewers', its scores stop being trustworthy. The
fix that needs no fine-tuning: show the judge a handful of **human-labeled
examples** in its prompt. Few-shot examples pull the judge toward your humans'
actual decisions.

This file defines one judge — "does the answer meet our HR house style?" — that
works in two modes:
  - zero-shot:  rubric only (the naive judge)
  - few-shot:   rubric + human-labeled examples (the aligned judge)

`judge_alignment.py` runs both against a held-out set of human labels and shows the
few-shot version agreeing with humans more often.

The catch that makes few-shot matter: the rubric is **deliberately
underspecified**. It tells the judge there's a house convention but not what it is
— exactly the situation you're in with any real team style that lives in
reviewers' heads, not in a doc. A zero-shot judge falls back on generic "is this a
good reply?" and misses the actual convention. The few-shot examples *are* the
convention, so they pull the judge onto it.

(For the curious: the convention these labels encode is "every reply must end with
an explicit invitation to follow up." We don't tell the judge that — the whole
point is that it has to learn it from the labeled examples.)
