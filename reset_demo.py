"""Reset the Session 2 demo state — delete the production project and the
annotation queue so a live run starts from a clean slate.

Run this between workshop cohorts (or before a fresh demo) so
`production_traffic.py` creates the project anew and the annotation queue starts
empty. Safe to run when nothing exists yet — missing targets are skipped.

Run:  python reset_demo.py
