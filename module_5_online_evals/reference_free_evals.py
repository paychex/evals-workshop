"""Module 5 — reference-free evaluators (for online evals on live traces).

Offline experiments (Modules 1–4) have a `reference_outputs` to grade against —
the dataset's ground truth. **Online** evals don't: a production trace is a real
user's question the agent has never seen, with no pre-written "right answer". So
online evaluators must judge an output using only what's *in the trace itself*
(the question, the answer, the tools the agent called) plus knowledge you already
hold (your policy corpus). Anything that needs a per-example reference can't run
online.

That constraint is the whole point of this file. Every evaluator here takes only
`(inputs, outputs)` — never `reference_outputs`:

  - response_not_empty   — deterministic: did we answer at all?
  - not_deflected        — deterministic heuristic: did the agent punt instead of help?
  - groundedness         — LLM judge: is every claim supported by the policy corpus?
  - professional_tone    — LLM judge: warm, clear, professional for a new hire?

The LLM judges follow Module 2's pattern (Pydantic structured output, temp-0
judge, `reasoning` surfaced as the comment) — see
module_2_single_turn/llm_judge_evals.py.
