"""Module 5 — simulate production traffic so we have live traces to evaluate.

Online evals run on whatever your app actually produces in production. To make
that concrete without a real deployment, this script runs the HR agent over a
batch of *messy, realistic* user questions — typos, ambiguity, and out-of-scope
asks you'd never put in a curated dataset — with **tracing enabled**, so each run
lands as a trace in a LangSmith project.

Once these traces exist, `score_traces.py` evaluates them with the reference-free
evaluators (the online-eval loop), and Module 6 pushes a sample to an annotation
queue for human review.

Run:  python module_5_online_evals/production_traffic.py
