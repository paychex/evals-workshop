"""Module 2 — structured output + shape validation.

A very common production pattern: you don't want free text, you want a typed
object your code can act on. The first thing to evaluate then is "did the
model return the right SHAPE?" — a purely deterministic check.

This file defines a structured-answer target and runs a tiny experiment scored
ONLY by the deterministic `structured_answer_is_valid` evaluator.

Run:  python module_2_single_turn/structured_output.py
